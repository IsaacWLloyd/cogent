THE PROBLEM

Coding Agents lose context and drift from specifications. Your vision gets lost in translation

Cogent solves this by eliminating the gap between intention and implementation

## visual explainer

1. Cogent picks your brain

with branching voice or text chat,
cogent explores your ideaspace from every angle

<---- Iterate and tunnel deeper [two way loop] ---->

2. cogent builds the blueprint
Cogent synthesizes the chat into design documents and technical specifications. 

[from the loop]--->
3. cogent crystallizes your intention.
The hierarchily linked specifications and branching chat history together form A linguistic object. A linguistic object is the perfect crystallization of your intention.

--->

4. cogent executes and validates.
using your linguistic object cogent strictly guides your coding agents as they implement your exact vision. Cogent defines how and where they should test and validates that all specifications are met.

# roadmap
vertical line roadmap with each step on opposite sides. at the top it says init with a solid line halfway to the first item. this line will change depending on our progress. the future lines are dotted.

## items
00. strong Agent compliance [expandable subtext]: cogent forces agents to document each change they take and link it in a hierarchical tree to the top level project documents

->

01. dynamic context management [expandable subtext]: cogent uses graph search and agentic context management to inject exactly what coding agents need to know and nothing more.

-> 

02. crystalized intention [expandable subtext]: cogent users chat with an assistant out loud or via text to build a Linguistic Object. This object encodes your entire idea starting from the big picture and includes precise technical details, design inspiration, outside documentation, wireframes, testing suites etc. 

-> 

03. fully automatic and valid code [expandable subtext]: In cogent projects any change to your linguistic object are implemented and validated automatically.

->

100. The world of forms [expandable subtext]: In a cogent world, thought forms of all types are seemlessly realized unlocking the next phase of civilization.
