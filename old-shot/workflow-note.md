# cool workflow
give initial idea in detail 
-> ask claude code to ask you as many questions as necessary to create a full spec of that idea one by one in multiple choice, yes or no, or free response format. 
-> review resultant spec and make adjustments 
-> ask claude code how this spec can be broken into parallel development paths to use parallel agents to build it. 
-> once you are satisfied with its division of labor have it write a grab details from the main spec for each agent and make a new file for each. 
-> open up X new claude code instances. ask each claude to think deeply and figure out what details its missing to fully implement its section. 
-> do the question loop again 
-> have it plan out what files it will write and what those will contain 
-> run all of them!
