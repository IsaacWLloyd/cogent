# concept

this is not super important now but it makes sense to vizualize the tree in 3 or even more dimensions because we have the 2d tree that lines up well with the project dir structure but then there can be specs that dont fit that. ie a change spec that applies across frontend and backend would not be in the hierarchical tree but rather is linked to specs that are.
