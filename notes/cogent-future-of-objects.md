# the spec tree
the spec tree is static, each version is linked to a static codebase or piece of validated code

# future objects
future objects should be able to go beyond this. we want objects that allow for uncertainty or agency like an object
for an NPC in VR, there would be static stuff like stick figure movements and the somewhat static is the video pipeline
to live generate their avatar. but we also want to be able to scaffold their personality in a way that the actual personality can't be output in a static object.

## clarification
the code object wraps all aspects of something static and logical, the NPC personality object wraps an idea space that could be written in a document but that would fail to capture its entirety as it is intricately linked to their state in the game and internally. 

Whats more we could have objects that wrap/interface with the fluidity of reality.

## code object can be like the NPC personality

some subset of the spec tree could be like the NPC personality in that it encodes a software idea in abstract but isnt tied to individual platform/infra/etc constraints. being able to isolate these would be incredibly powerful as it would allow easy adaption to any manifestation. 

one step up the stack from this is abstract ideas about the world that can be usefully concretized as software as literature as a vr world etc. being able to encode these objects will be the next step function in cogents value.
