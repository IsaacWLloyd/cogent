# what is it?
a spec has plaintext explanation but also has linked child specs. a spec can
only be a leaf node if it is linked to the a specific piece of the final artifact (code for now)

## templating

probably makes sense to prep spec templates for standard stuff. this also helps the conversational spec building to be more dialed. ie the initial conversation gets a general project idea -> picks top level spec templates--populates them
 then prioritizes which part of the general spec(s) should be done first -> and then does this recursive

# md representation.

the md document of a spec could have links to the md docs of its child specs. allowing paintext navigation and
export of the whole spec tree.
