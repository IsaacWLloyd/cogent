# Parallel Development Sprints - COGENT

## Overview
This document outlines the parallel sprint structure for developing COGENT in a single day (8-10 hours) using multiple AI agents working simultaneously.

## Sprint Structure

### Sprint 0: Foundation & Contracts (1 hour - Sequential)
**Critical Path - All teams depend on this**
- Define all API contracts (OpenAPI spec)
- Define database schema (SQLAlchemy models)
- Define shared types/interfaces
- Create mock data generators
- Set up monorepo structure with proper dependencies
- Define Vercel function structure and routing
- Set up vercel.json configuration

### Sprint 1: Core Infrastructure (3-4 hours - Parallel)

#### Team 1: Backend Core
- FastAPI application in /api/main.py
- Vercel handler setup for FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy models with Neon connection
- Basic CRUD endpoints for projects, documents, users
- Clerk webhook endpoints and middleware
- Error handling for serverless environment
- Structured logging for Vercel

#### Team 2: Frontend Foundation
- React + Vite setup with TypeScript
- Routing structure (React Router)
- SHADCN UI component library setup
- API client with mocked responses
- State management setup
- Layout components (Dashboard, Sidebar, Header)

#### Team 3: MCP Server
- PydanticAI agent as Vercel Function in /mcp
- Tool definitions (search_documentation, validate_relevance)
- HTTP/SSE transport for serverless
- Direct Neon database access
- Pydantic models for all data structures
- Serverless-optimized error handling
- Connection pooling for MCP operations

#### Team 4: Database & Search
- Neon database setup with connection pooling
- Full-text search with Neon's PostgreSQL
- pgvector setup for embeddings
- Serverless connection patterns
- Database seeding scripts
- Index optimization
- Migration scripts

#### Team 5: Vercel Configuration
- vercel.json setup with proper routing
- Environment variable configuration
- Build settings for frontend and functions
- Development server configuration
- Function memory and timeout limits
- CORS and security headers

### Sprint 2: Feature Implementation (3-4 hours - Parallel)

#### Team 1: Documentation Logic
- Hook implementation for Claude Code
- Documentation generation logic
- File change detection algorithms
- Async task spawning with FastAPI BackgroundTasks
- Template system for documentation
- Cross-reference updating

#### Team 2: Authentication & Security
- Clerk webhook integration with FastAPI
- Clerk middleware for request validation
- User sync from Clerk to database
- API key generation for MCP access (custom)
- Rate limiting middleware with Clerk user IDs
- Permission system for projects tied to Clerk organizations

#### Team 3: Frontend Features
- Dashboard view with project list
- Project management interface
- Documentation search UI
- Settings pages (user, project, templates)
- Usage analytics display
- Billing interface mockup

#### Team 4: Integration & Testing
- API integration test suite
- MCP-Backend communication testing
- End-to-end test scenarios
- Error handling validation
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation validation tests

### Sprint 3: Integration & Polish (1-2 hours - Sequential)
- Connect all components
- Resolve integration conflicts
- Deploy to development environment
- Run comprehensive smoke tests
- Fix critical bugs
- Prepare demo

## Parallel Development Strategy

### Mock-First Development
- Each team works against mocked dependencies
- All mocks follow the contracts defined in Sprint 0
- Mocks are replaced with real implementations in Sprint 3

### Contract-Driven Design
- All APIs defined upfront in OpenAPI format
- TypeScript types generated from OpenAPI
- Shared types package used by all components
- Strict adherence to interface contracts

### Feature Flags
- Components can be toggled on/off
- Gradual integration capability
- Fallback to mocks when real implementation unavailable

### Communication Protocol
- All teams use the same Git repository
- Frequent commits to feature branches
- Integration happens on develop branch
- Clear commit messages with team identifiers

## Success Criteria

### Sprint 0
- [ ] Complete OpenAPI specification
- [ ] All database models defined
- [ ] Shared types package created
- [ ] Mock data generators working
- [ ] Monorepo properly structured

### Sprint 1
- [ ] All four infrastructure components running independently
- [ ] Each component has basic functionality with mocks
- [ ] No integration required yet

### Sprint 2
- [ ] All features implemented against mocks
- [ ] Unit tests passing for each component
- [ ] Documentation generated for test files

### Sprint 3
- [ ] All components integrated
- [ ] End-to-end flow working
- [ ] Basic demo ready

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Integration Conflicts**: Strict contract adherence minimizes conflicts
2. **Time Overruns**: Features can be cut without breaking core functionality
3. **Dependency Issues**: Mock-first allows progress even if dependencies fail
4. **Communication Gaps**: All contracts defined upfront in Sprint 0

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Bun (latest)
- Python (latest)
- Vercel CLI
- Neon account
- Clerk account

### Quick Start
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `bun install && pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure `.env.local` with all keys
4. Run `vercel dev` to start all services
5. Access http://localhost:3000

### Serverless Testing
- Use `vercel dev` to simulate serverless environment
- Test cold starts with function restarts
- Monitor function logs in terminal
- Use Vercel dashboard for production-like testing

## Tools & Technologies

- **Backend**: Python Vercel Functions, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Neon
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, SHADCN UI
- **MCP Server**: PydanticAI as Vercel Function
- **Testing**: Pytest, Jest, Playwright
- **Deployment**: Vercel CLI, Git
- **Development**: Vercel Dev for local testing
