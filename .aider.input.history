+Update middleware.ts
+
+Update your middleware file, or create one at the root of your project, or the src/ directory if you're using a src/ directory structure.
+
+The clerkMiddleware helper enables authentication and is where you'll configure your protected routes.
+middleware.ts
+
+import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";
+
+export default clerkMiddleware();
+
+export const config = {
+  matcher: [
+    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
+    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
+    // Always run for API routes
+    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
+  ],
+}; run this step for me for getting clerk installed. i dont think i have a middleware file yet

+Add ClerkProvider to your app
+
+The ClerkProvidercomponent provides Clerk's authentication context to your app. It's recommended to wrap your entire app at the entry point with ClerkProvider to make authentication globally accessible. See the reference docs for other configuration options.
+
+Copy and paste the following file into your layout.tsx file. This creates a header with Clerk's prebuilt components to allow users to sign in and out.

+Pages Router
